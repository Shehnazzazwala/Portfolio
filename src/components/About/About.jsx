            I'm a recent Information Technology graduate from the LJ Institute of Engineering and Technology, where I completed my four-year Bachelor of Engineering degree. My academic journey ignited a deep passion for the worlds of Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Machine Learning, and I am now actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills to solve real-world challenges.
          </p>
          <p className="about-content-item">
            This passion isn't just theoretical; it's the driving force behind my hands-on projects, which span from complex Machine Learning models to robust applications using Python, DBMS, and the MERN stack. I thrive in collaborative, high-pressure environments, an experience I've eagerly sought out by participating in hackathons like DA-IICT's HackOut'23, the NASA Space Apps Challenge, and Datathrone.
          </p>
          <p className="about-content-item">
            Beyond the keyboard, I'm a creative at heart. In my free time, you'll find me painting, sketching, or doodling. My time playing on a state-level school basketball team also taught me the value of discipline, teamwork, and a competitive drive to succeedâ€”qualities I bring to every project I undertake.
